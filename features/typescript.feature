@typescript
Feature: Typescript Definitions

    As a typescript developer
    I want to be able to implement step definitions in typescript
    So I can use my existing typescript classes, interface, etc in my step definitions

    This feature is intended to work as a demonstration that the typescript definitions 
    are correctly mapped with the cucumber-js API.

    Scenario: 
        Given a typescript feature
